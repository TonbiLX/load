Project Name: "Container Load Visualizer"

Project Description:
"Container Load Visualizer" is a software designed to efficiently organize and visualize the contents of loading containers. This tool optimizes container loading using the dimensions and weights of various products and provides both 2D and 3D perspective visualizations of the loading process.

Main Features:
Data Entry: Enter product dimensions and weights via an Excel spreadsheet or manual input.
Loading Optimization: Ensures the most efficient placement of products within the container.
Visualization: Provides visual representations of the loading in both 2D and 3D perspectives, allowing users to clearly see the container's interior arrangement.
Volume and Weight Information: Displays total volume, total weight, remaining volume, and remaining tonnage.
User-Friendly Interface: Offers an intuitive and user-friendly interface for ease of use.
Zoom Feature: Includes zoom in and zoom out buttons for resizing the visualization area.
Loading Progress Bar: Features a loading progress bar to show the progress of the loading operation.
Purpose:
This software is developed to enhance loading efficiency and optimize container usage for companies operating in the logistics and transportation sectors. It saves time in loading planning and minimizes errors in loading.

How to Use:

Enter product information (name, length, width, height, weight, quantity) into the table or paste it from Excel.
Select the type of container to be loaded.
Press the "Load" button to optimize and visualize the loading process.
Examine the loading arrangement in the visualization area and use the zoom in and zoom out buttons for detailed observation if needed.
After the loading is complete, check the total volume and weight information, as well as the remaining volume and tonnage.
This project contributes to the effective and efficient management of loading processes.
